## Introduction
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. This project showcases how to set up and use FastAPI to create a robust API with features such as automatic interactive API documentation, dependency injection, and asynchronous request handling.

## Features
Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic).
Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%.
Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors.
Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration.
Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI and JSON Schema.
